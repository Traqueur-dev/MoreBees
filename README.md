## 📘 Recipes Usage: How It Works

All custom recipes in this plugin are powered by [**RecipesAPI**](https://github.com/Traqueur-Dev/RecipesAPI) — a lightweight and flexible library purpose-built to simplify and centralize the crafting system in Minecraft.

This API was developed in-house to streamline how recipes are created, registered, and managed. It supports two ways to define recipes:

* **YAML files** – perfect for server owners and developers who prefer clean, file-based configuration.
* **Java code** – ideal for dynamic recipe generation or advanced programmatic control.

With **RecipesAPI**, you can:

* Easily add, modify, or remove recipes without dealing with low-level Minecraft internals.
* Automatically validate crafting inputs and prevent invalid crafts.
* Use custom items, tags, and even advanced conditions in your recipes.

🔍 For full documentation, visit the [**GitHub Wiki**](https://github.com/Traqueur-Dev/RecipesAPI/wiki). It includes everything you need — from YAML format examples to Java integration guides — to get started and make the most of RecipesAPI.
